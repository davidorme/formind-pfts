# formind-pfts

This repo contains predominantly R code duplicating the FORMIND parameterisation of plant functional types. The main point is to provide quick tools to visualise a PFT with given parameters, including the geometry of the PFT and the growth of the PFT under simplified conditions (constant illumination, no water or temperature constraint).
